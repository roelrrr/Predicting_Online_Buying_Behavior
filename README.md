# Predicting Online Buying Behavior [(Kaggle competition)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/techscape-ecommerce/leaderboard?tab=public)




* Build a predictive model that answer the question "Which customers are more likely to buy our products?"
* 9.999 records with 17 features
* Use PCA to reduce dimensionality 
* Evaluation criteria: F1 score
* Testing the following ML models: Linear & Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Instance based KNN-Classifier, Decision Tree, Neural Networks, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest, Bagging Classifier, Stacking Classifier
* All our notebooks for the different modeling can be found [here](https://github.com/roelrrr/Predicting_Online_Buying_Behavior/tree/main/Scripts)

* Based upon F1 scores we checked which method had the best outcome
* We developed a model that was good for a 9th place of a total of 56 groups
* A full report about our modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/roelrrr/Predicting_Online_Buying_Behavior/blob/main/Description/Guidelines_Group_Project_Master_202122.pdf)
